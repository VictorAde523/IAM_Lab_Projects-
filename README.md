# Okta Fundamentals â€“ Hands-On Practice & Notes

This repository contains hands-on labs, notes, and practice configurations based on the **"Okta Fundamentals with Okta Identity Engine"** Udemy course by Bryan Ferragamo.

## Course Overview

The course covers the core concepts and practical configurations involved in Okta Identity and Access Management (IAM), including:

- Okta Developer Console setup
- Identity types (users, groups, admins)
- Authentication policies
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Application integrations
- Lifecycle management
- Okta Workflows (intro level)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Okta Developer Account** (https://developer.okta.com)
- Okta Identity Engine
- Sample web app (for testing SSO & MFA flows)
- GitHub (for documentation)
- Optional: Postman (API testing)

---

## Hands-On Labs & Practice

### 1. Okta Developer Account Setup
- Created developer tenant at `dev-[subdomain].okta.com`
- Explored Admin Console: Dashboard, Directory, Security, Applications

### 2. User & Group Management
- Created test users manually and via CSV import
- Created custom groups (e.g., Engineering, HR)
- Assigned users to groups for role-based access control

### 3. App Integration & SSO
- Integrated sample app using OIDC
- Set up login redirect URI, client ID/secret
- Tested SSO login flows
- Configured app assignment for groups

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enabled MFA policies for specific groups
- Configured Okta Verify & SMS as authenticators
- Tested step-up authentication

### 5. Sign-On & Access Policies
- Created custom sign-on policies (e.g., geo-based, IP restrictions)
- Configured session timeouts
- Assigned different policies to apps

### 6. Lifecycle Management
- Created automation rules for user provisioning and deprovisioning
- Tested account suspension based on status changes
- Set up password policies

### 7. Intro to Okta Workflows
- Reviewed flow builder UI
- Sample: auto-assign user to group after app assignment
